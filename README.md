hstyle is a code style checker for Haskell programs.  So far it's just a
quick-and-dirty implementation of a few of the simplest requirements found in
the [Snap Framework's Haskell Style
Guide](http://snapframework.com/docs/style-guide).  In the future we hope to
build more sophisticated checking.  The ultimate goal would be an automatic
reformatter that generates gorgeous code--but that's a hard problem.
